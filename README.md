# r-data-analysis-project

This project explores COVID-19 case and death trends across major Australian states using publicly available data from COVIDLive.com.au. The goal was to extract, clean, visualize, and model pandemic data to uncover patterns and build predictive insights.
The analysis covers data from 2020 to 2025, focusing on:
- Daily case and death counts
- State-wise comparisons
- Trends normalized by population
- Predictive modeling of death rates
The project was completed as part of an academic assessment, using R and key packages like rvest, tidyverse, ggplot2, and plotly.

Tools & Technologies
- Language: R
- Libraries: rvest, dplyr, ggplot2, plotly, readr, lubridate

Data Source: COVIDLive.com.au

Key Highlights
- Built interactive visualizations to explore temporal and regional trends
- Normalized data per 100,000 population to enable fair comparisons
- Modeled linear relationships between new cases and deaths with RÂ² > 0.89
- Presented findings in a structured report with clear insights and forecasts
